The comedi_nonfree_firmware tarball contains firmware for boards which
cannot be included in the main comedi package due to licensing or
copyright issues.  The firmware can generally be uploaded to boards
by using comedi_config with the -i or --init-data option.  See the
README in the subdirectory corresponding to your board's driver for
more information.
