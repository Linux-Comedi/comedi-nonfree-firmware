The jr3pci.idm file in this directory contains firmware for the jr3_pci 
driver.  Note, this driver does not load its firmware through comedi_config,
but rather relies on the generic support in the Linux kernel for firmware 
upload.  The jr3pci.idm file should be installed into the directory
/lib/firmware/comedi/
