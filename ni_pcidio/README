This directory contains firmware for the National Instruments pci-6534
board.  The firmware files can be loaded when comedi_config is run
by using the --init-data0, --init-data1, and --init-data2 
options.  The path to the ni6534a.bin file should be 
passed as the argument of the --init-data0 option.
The niscrb01.bin file path is passed to --init-data1, and the
niscrb02.bin file path is passed to --init-data2.  
All three firmware files should be passed
to a single execution of comedi_config.  The niscrb03.bin file is not used.
You will need to use comedi_config from comedilib version 0.7.23
or later, and the ni_pcidio driver from comedi version 0.7.70 or later for
this to have any chance or working.  The firmware needs to be loaded
into the board after every power-up.  To the best of my knowledge, these
firmware files are all copyright National Instruments, and no one involved
with Comedi has any access to their source code.

File descriptions:

ni6534a.bin: Firmware for the main FPGA

niscrb01.bin: Firmware to program a "scarab" for digital input mode,
  loaded into "scarab A" by the driver.

niscrb02.bin: Firmware to program a "scarab" for digital output mode,
  loaded into "scarab B" by the driver.

niscrb03.bin: Firmware to program a "scarab" for "mem detect" mode,
  unused.
